Assignment 4:-
Tic-Tac-Toe against AI
Using Adverserial Search, and mini-max strategy to find the best move for the AI against the given input (The input is given as per the location). Later Alpha-Beta Pruning, to implement the search in a more efficient manner. 


Assignment 5:-
First part is on use of pycosat to solve a CNF.

Secondly, A random set of people are generated and their heights and weights are also randomly generated according to the probabilities. Then we take an input and according to the nearest neighbours, a prediction is made if that set of height and weight is a child or an adult.

Third part is use of dynamic programming to calculate the optimal action according to the given probabilities of risks for each run score.


Assignment 6:-
First part is a Spam Filter using Naive Bayes' Classifier, the keywords are stored according to the given input messages. The words of new input message are used to make prediction using the naive bayes' classifier, whether the message is spam or not.

For the second part, we classify each person randomly as a child or an adult. According to that, we generate random heights and weights and make a classifier from that which predicts a person is adult or kid from the height and weight of the person. The accuracy of the predictions are measured.
